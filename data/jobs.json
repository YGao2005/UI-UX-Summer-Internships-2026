In past roles, our team members found it very hard to make a big impact when companies grow too large in size, which has a detrimental effect on the product and the impact any single individual can have. Our team includes designers, engineers, product experts, and finance \\& operation focused on one thing \u2014 connecting people over sports. We believe in fair and equitable pay. Certain locations in the United States require job postings to include a reasonable estimate of the base salary range and/or a general description of benefits and other compensation applicable to the role.\n\n\nFor this role in those locations, a reasonable estimate of the base compensation range for new hires is $20 USD to $32 USD per hour. No overtime work allowed, and the internship will be for 12 weeks or otherwise negotiated; salary upon potential, full\\-time conversion will be adjusted and further negotiated.\n\n\nPlease note that the compensation range for this role takes into account a wide range of factors that are considered in making compensation decisions including, but not limited to, skill sets; experience and training; licensure and certifications; and other business and organizational needs.

Dexcom began as a small company with a big dream: To forever change how diabetes is managed. To unlock information and insights that drive better health outcomes. Here we are 25 years later, having pioneered an industry. And we're just getting started. We are broadening our vision beyond diabetes to empower people to take control of health.
