Here we are 25 years later, having pioneered an industry. And we're just getting started. We are broadening our vision beyond diabetes to empower people to take control of health.

This is where you come in.\n\nDuring your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here https://notion.notion.site/Notion-Intern-Spotlight-d0260c4e2317490db89f367d95cb4e68 and here https://www.notion.so/blog/saluting-notions-winter-interns and TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@notionhq/video/7216440106356395306?lang=en post.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\n - Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\n\n - Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.\n\n - Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.\n\n - Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS:\n\n - Pursuing a bachelor's or master\u2019s degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before December 2026.\n\n - Previous internship experience.\n\n - Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.\n\n - You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.\n\n - You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.\n\n - This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU\u2019LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\n - For a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together\u2014from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.\n\n - For a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.\n\n - Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact\u2014good and bad.\n\n - Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\n - Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\n - Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.\n\n - You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others\u2014and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\n - You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.
